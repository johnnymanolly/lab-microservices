## Part B
# provide your own thoughts (i.e. user-stories), where OPA can be a good fit for the fictious FMS in Part A:

 The Open Policy Agent (OPA) could be more efficient if rules and policies are set dynamically in a real time. A good practice would be using IoT plugins such as Simple decision Table, State Machine, Blockly, etc.. and issuing tickets automatically when a thresholds is validated.

# What is the benefit of OPA?

 The Open Policy Agent (OPA) allow us to set rules and policies outside the core of the service.

# where could OPA potentially reside in the FMS architecture?

 The Open Policy Agent (OPA) resides better in a separate service.
